2025-01-14 11:18:42,134 - INFO - Query response: Based on the data provided from the `Buildings.csv`, it appears that the dataset consists of 43 buildings. However, the specific data provided does not include any record with a building located in Chicago.

To accurately determine the number of buildings in Chicago, we would need access to the full dataset. If you can provide more data or the entire list, I can verify this for you. If the dataset truly has no buildings listed in Chicago, then the count is zero.

2025-01-14 11:19:28,835 - INFO - Query response: To determine the number of buildings that are leased versus owned, we can examine the "Ownership" column in the `Buildings.csv` dataset. Based on the data sample provided, we can see:

- "Own": This appears multiple times in the sample, indicating buildings that are owned.
- "Lease": This also appears in the sample, indicating buildings that are leased.

Now let's perform a computation on this basis from the sample:

### Computation Steps:

1. Identify unique records for "Ownership" status.
2. Count the number of buildings under each category.

From the data provided:

- **Owned Buildings**:
  - Building IDs: B005, B040, B029, B036, B007, B021, B025, B002 (Total of 8 in the sample)

- **Leased Buildings**:
  - Building IDs: B015, B033 (Total of 2 in the sample)

### Insights:

- In the sample provided, there are **8 owned buildings** and **2 leased buildings**.

If we had the entire dataset, we could provide the precise numbers for all 43 buildings. If you have any additional specifics or the full list, I can refine this further.
